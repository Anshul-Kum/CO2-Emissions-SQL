# CO2-Emissions-SQL

## Project Overview
The project investigates the past emissions of carbon dioxide in order to find some relations, insights and trends, which contain global CO2 emissions. Analysis through SQL allows to look deeper into emission trends by country, by decade, and on global scales. The aim of the project is to provide evidence that will help in decision making processes regarding the environmental concerns and policies.

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv), which contains records of CO2 emissions across different countries and years. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Country**: Name of the country.
- **Year**: The year of the emissions data.
- **Series**: Type of measurement (e.g., emissions in metric tons or per capita).
- **Value**: The measured value of emissions.

## Key Analysis and Findings
### Trend of Increasing Carbon Emissions by Decade
- Analyzed average emissions across decades.
- Finding: Average emissions almost doubled between the 1970s and the 2010s, indicating a steady upward trend in global CO2 emissions.
### Top and Bottom Contributors to Emissions
- Top 10 Countries with Highest Emissions: Countries like China, the USA, and India lead the emissions chart.
- Top 10 Countries with Lowest Emissions: Smaller countries in South Africa dominate the list of least emitters.
### Countries with the Highest Increase or Decrease in Emissions
- Using a year-over-year comparison, the analysis revealed:
  * Countries with the Highest Increase: China, India, Republic of Korea, and Saudi Arabia.
  * Countries with the Largest Decrease: Germany, the UK, France, and Romania.
### Global Growth Rate of Emissions
- Calculated the annual growth rate of global CO2 emissions.
- Insight: The most significant growth occurred between 1985 and 2005. Since then, the global growth rate has slowed.

## Areas of Further Investigation
More datasets can be used in additions to this one to analyze the following:
- Regional Analysis
- Per Capita Emissions
- Correlation with Economic Growth
